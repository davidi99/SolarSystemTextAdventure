Session Title:

Using Modern AI tooling to Create a Working Delphi Multi-Device Application with David Intersimone

Session Description:

Wherever developers look they can read about modern AI’s impact on software development. How much time should a developer spend trying to separate the ground breaking potential, confusing hype and rapid advances in the usefulness and quality of development tools? The only way I know, for myself, is to keep up to date and try to build applications from scratch using as many tools, APIs, libraries, components and 50+ years of experience with computer science and software engineering. In this talk, I will use one (or more) of the (currently) top modern AI coding solutions to build a working Delphi multi-device application using RAD Studio 13. Join me for my development (Mister Toad’s) wild ride and travel down the (Alice’s) rabbit hole. Schedule: December 02, 2025 | 3:00 PM (CST)
